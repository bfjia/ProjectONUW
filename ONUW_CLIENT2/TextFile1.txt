Does this work:
1. no change to server, everyone does their action async
	1.1 action input is stored in the list ActionInputs<guid> and the actionDone flag is set to true
2. during performActions(), store the 'current' json in actionResults and return it to client as the allplayers json
3. Client parse the json in it's own actionResult from the json of AllPlayers.
4. Display result on screen and proceed to discussion.
